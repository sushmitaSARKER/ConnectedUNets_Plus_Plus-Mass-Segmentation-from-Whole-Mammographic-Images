# ConnectedUNets++ & ConeectedUNets+

In this article, we present two novel and improved versions of the Connected-UNets, ConnectedUNets+ and ConnectedUNets++, by utilizing residual skip connections and enhanced encoder-decoder in order 
to achieve better convergence. The proposed architectures uses full mammogram image contrast to many popular model which operates on cropped images of correctly detected and classified masses by an 
object detection model.
