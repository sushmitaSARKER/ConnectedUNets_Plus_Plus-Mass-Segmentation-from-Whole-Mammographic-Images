# ConnectedUNets++ & ConeectedUNets+

In this work, we introduce ConnectedUNets+ and ConnectedUNets++, two novel and significantly improved deep learning architectures for breast cancer segmentation. These models enhance the original Connected-UNets framework by integrating residual skip connections and a more advanced encoder-decoder structure. These key modifications are designed to promote smoother gradient flow and stabilize the training process, leading to better and more reliable convergence.

A primary advantage of our proposed models is their ability to operate directly on full mammogram images. This approach stands in contrast to many popular methods that depend on a multi-stage pipeline where an object detection model must first identify and crop a region of interest (ROI) containing the mass. By analyzing the entire mammogram, our models can leverage broader contextual information and simplify the clinical workflow.

The main contributions of this work are:

1. Novel Architectures: We propose ConnectedUNets+ and ConnectedUNets++, two improved versions of Connected-UNets that utilize residual skip connections and an enhanced encoder-decoder to achieve superior convergence.

2. Full Mammogram Analysis: We assess the proposed architectures on full, uncropped mammogram images, differentiating our work from baseline models that require pre-processed, cropped ROIs generated by an external object detector.

3. Rigorous Experimental Validation: We conducted extensive experiments using all images from two challenging public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INbreast) to demonstrate the models' robust performance in segmenting breast mass tumors.
